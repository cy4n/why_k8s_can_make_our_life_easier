# Service Mesh - Istio

## Prerequisites

- [Install a multi node cluster in your machine](/cluster/ubuntu/README.md)
- [Be sured to have running and configured helm and a private registry](/steps/0#install-a-self-contained-registry)
- [Configure some apps before install the service mesh](/steps/10/app/README.md)

Afterwards you should have running a cluster of three nodes (one master and two workers), with Kubernetes installed on it. Also there is a registry running exposing an endpoint in every node to allow container runtime to pull images inside the cluster. We have port forward the registry to be able to push images to the aforementioned registry. At the same time, Helm has been configured in the cluster help maitain our application. Finally, we have used `draft` to build and deploy the example application. It means we are ready to start our journey through the Istio world.

## 0. Deploy Istio in our cluster

For the installation, we will leverage in helm to deploy Istio easily
```
# Get the latest version of the project 
$ curl -L https://git.io/getLatestIstio | sh -

# Install Custom Resources first
$ kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/helm/istio/templates/crds.yaml

# Install Istio componentskubectl get validatingwebhookconfiguration -o yaml
$ helm install install/kubernetes/helm/istio --name istio --namespace istio-system --set tracing.enabled=true --set grafana.enabled=true --set servicegraph.enabled=true
```
It creates all custom resources and services to manage the service mesh

Let's check all components coming up correctly
```
$ kubectl get pod -n istio-system -w
```

Once all components are on good shape, we can said Istio is ready for playing!

Let's start to see the powerness of istio.

## Inject the sidecars

All the components have been deployed but the existing apps are not part of the mesh yet. To make it happens we need to inject eh sidecar which will proxy all traffic and apply the policies. There are two different ways to inject it, automated and manual.

### Automatic

The automated injection mechanism relies on the mutate admission controllers functionality offered by Kubernetes API. Just labelling the namespace that we want will make all deployments launch there will contain the sidecar.

```
$ kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```

### Manual

For manual deployment we use the istio `ctl` which converts the resource deployment `yaml` injecting an extra container.

```
$ kubectl get deploy frontend-app -o yaml | istioctl kube-inject -f - | kubectl apply -f -
$ kubectl get deploy backend-app -o yaml | istioctl kube-inject -f - | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Verify sidecar status

Now the number of containers in the pod is two

```
$ k get po                                                                         
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
backend-app-5f4fd5c6f8-v2mlv    2/2       Running   0          1m
frontend-app-7fdf46cbbb-qm4hp   2/2       Running   0          2m
```

Another option is to take a look to the envoy admin panel which output information of the sidecar configuration and state.

```
$ kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pod -l app=frontend-app -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")  15000:15000
```

Now in the browser go to `localhost:15000` and take a look at the configuration.

We can also observed the certs generated and injected in the pod running 
`kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=frontend-app -o jsonpath={.items[0]..metadata.name}) -c istio-proxy -- ls /etc/certs`

Or checking the cert valid dates.
`kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=backend-app -o jsonpath={.items[0]..metadata.name}) -c istio-proxy -- cat /etc/certs/cert-chain.pem | openssl x509 -text -noout  | grep Validity -A 2`

## 1. Security

### 1.1 Transparent mutual tls

One of the coolest features of Istio is letting us upgrade our security within our services without any change in our code. 

Thanks to having a sidecar set as a proxy next yo our apps, the traffic protocol can be encrypted and decrypted between the sidecars seamlessly. Further Istio implements its own version of SPIFFE, making sure the destination service is really which it supposed to be.

The authentication configuration is driven via policies. You can configure a policy at mesh, namespace or service level. For example, below we decide that backend will be accessed using mutual TLS.

```yaml
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "Policy"
metadata:
  name: "backend"
spec:
  targets:
  - name: backend
  peers:
  - mtls: {}
```

Before apply the policy, lets verify it works as intendeed. We can first intercept the traffic to the backend pod and see it is not encrypted (we uses http in port 80). We ssh to one Virtual box node and run a tcpdump

```
$ vagrant ssh node1

(node1) $ sudo tcpdump -nnXs 0 'host <backend pod IP>' -vv | grep Istio 
```

__Note:__ The backend pod IP can be get it running `kubectl get pods --namespace default -l app=backend-app -o wide | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $6; }'`


The output you will see is something like
```
  	{"grettings":"Hi Istio workshop from v1"}
50 packets captured
```

Now let's apply the policy and a destination rule which enforce mutal TLS between frontend and backend:

```
$ kubectl apply -f app/policy_mtls.yaml
```

To check the authentication is set correctly you can run the below command and check the status column:

```
$ istioctl authn tls-check backend-app.default.svc.cluster.local
HOST:PORT           STATUS     SERVER     CLIENT     AUTHN POLICY            DESTINATION RULE
backend-app...:80     OK        mTLS       mTLS     backend-app/default     backend-rule/default
```

Now you can run `tcpdump` again in the node and the output will be empty. TLS encryption is doing its work :).

Another nice probe to perform to understand it better, it is to curl from the frontend istio proxy to the backend with the right certs:
```
$ kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=frontend-app -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c istio-proxy -- curl https://backend-app:80 -s --key /etc/certs/key.pem --cert /etc/certs/cert-chain.pem --cacert /etc/certs/root-cert.pem -k

{"grettings":"Hi Istio workshop from v1"}%
```

### 1.2 RBAC within services

Kubernetes is shipped with RBAC included. It means that Kubernetes generates a token for the services run in its platform. By default all services use same default token, and it is used to authenticate and authorize against the Kuberentes API. 

But it can not be used to configure authorization between services. Istio extends Kubernetes RBAC to make it possible.

Before starting to set the rules, let's deploy a new version of the backend to make the later probes more meaningful.

```
$ cd backend2 && draft up
```

Let's make a quick test and access from the the frontend to the backend version 1. It must work:
```
$ kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=frontend-app -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c istio-proxy -- curl https://backend-app:80 -s --key /etc/certs/key.pem --cert /etc/certs/cert-chain.pem --cacert /etc/certs/root-cert.pem -k

{"grettings":"Hi Istio workshop from v2"}
```

But if we enable RBAC in the namespace:
```
$ kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
```

Now the curl command will fail:
```
$ kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=frontend-app -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c istio-proxy -- curl https://backend-app:80 -s --key /etc/certs/key.pem --cert /etc/certs/cert-chain.pem --cacert /etc/certs/root-cert.pem -k

RBAC: access denied
```

All inner communication in the `default` namespace it is not authorized. Next step is allow the communication from frontend to the backend version 2 as example.

```
$ kubectl apply -f authZ.yaml
```

And now the curl command exectued for both backends return:
```
$ kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=frontend-app -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c istio-proxy -- curl https://backend-app:80 -s --key /etc/certs/key.pem --cert /etc/certs/cert-chain.pem --cacert /etc/certs/root-cert.pem -k
RBAC: access denied%                                                                            

$ kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=frontend-app -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c istio-proxy -- curl https://backendv2-app:80 -s --key /etc/certs/key.pem --cert /etc/certs/cert-chain.pem --cacert /etc/certs/root-cert.pem -k
{"grettings":"Hi Istio workshop from v2"}%
```

The authorization system is much complex. As example you can authorize finer grained access to your services, and only enable authorization for a single service instead all namespace. Also it can be applied to external traffic (user).

## 2. Route shifting

### 2.1 Ingress traffic

Set the a hostname for the frontend
```
$ vim edit /etc/hosts (in your machine)
172.17.4.11     frontend.example.com
```

Ensure ingress gateway service to use node port.
```
$ kubectl edit service istio-ingressgateway -n kube-system
```
The `type` must be `NodePort`. Otherwise we need to change it. Also we need to now which it is the allocated port in the host network.
```
$ export INGRESS_PORT=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http2")].nodePort}')

$ echo $INGRESS_PORT
```

By default Istio deny all traffic in/out the cluster. In case we want to route the request to our frontends we need to define a couple of resources.


First let's create a gateway which tells an ingress gateway envoy to listen to for a determined hostname, port and protocol.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: frontend-app-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway # use istio default controller
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "*"
```

Secondly, we need to create a `VirtualService` which will make use of the gatewaya and will route the traffic from it to the desired destionations.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: frontend-app
spec:
  hosts:
  - "*"
  gateways:
  - frontend-app-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: /v1
    route:
    - destination:
        host: frontend-app
        port:
          number: 3000
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: frontendv2-app
        port:
          number: 3000
```

At this point we should be able to see frontend version one in the URL `http://frontend.example.com:$INGRESS_PORT/v1` and second version on `http://frontend.example.com:$INGRESS_PORT/whatever_you_put`.

### 2.2 Egress traffic

For the egress traffic it happens the same, you need to enable via configuration the out going traffic. In the example apps, I added an call to an external service `api.openweathermap.org` to get the weather information of Mannheim. 

As first step let's try to call the frontend url which access the weather system to see the results. Browsing to `http://frontend.example.com:31380/weather` it will give you an error.

So in order to enable traffic out we need to define a `ServiceEntry` which allows requests going out to `api.openweathermap.org` for the whole mesh.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: openweathermap
spec:
  hosts:
  - api.openweathermap.org
  ports:
  - number: 80
    name: http
    protocol: HTTP
  resolution: DNS
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
```

After submit this manifest to the Kubernetes API you should be able to see the intended data.

### 2.3 Traffic shifting

In this field the possibilities are endedless. We can do canary deployments, controlling traffic in really granular way. We can do shadow deployments, using a header to access to a new service version. Another option can be mirror traffic for testing purposes to a new release version.

Here let's explore a couple of options. First one, it would be divide the traffic between different versions. To do that we use a `VirtualService`, as we have done before, but now we set another destination and a `weight` property to tell our proxy how much traffic they should forward and where.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: backend-app
spec:
  hosts:
  - backend-app
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: backendv2-app
      weight: 50
    - destination:
        host: backend-app
      weight: 50
```

You can play with the number and see how it works as expected (http://frontend.example.com:31380/v1).

Another way to test a new service version it sneakily via request headers. As an example let's change our virtual service to something like

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: frontend-app
spec:
  hosts:
  - "*"
  gateways:
  - frontend-app-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        device:
          exact: android
    route:
    - destination:
        host: frontendv2-app
        port:
          number: 3000
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: frontend-app
        port:
          number: 3000
```

It will make all request goes to the frontend version one. Only requests with a header `device: android` will be redirected to new frontend version. You can use [modheader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj?hl=en) in chrome to tune your request headers and being able to test it.

### 2.4 Fault injection

Last step in the traffic shifting is to make use of fault injection feature envoy provides. Sometimes we want to test the resilence of your micro services so this manner can be easily probed.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: backend-app
spec:
  hosts:
  - backend-app
  http:
  - fault:
      abort:
        httpStatus: 500
        percent: 100
    route:
    - destination:
        host: backend-app
      weight: 100
```

Here we are generating HTTP 500 responses when backend service is called. As you can see the frontend one cannot handle right the errors as opposed to the second version

# 3. Tracing and monitoring

## 3.1 Tracing

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward -n istio-system $(kubectl get pod -n istio-system -l app=jaeger -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 16686:16686 &
```

## 3.2 Monitoring

To make effictive the tracing we need to tweak a bit our code to transport the headers from one service to the next one. These are the header we are forwading downstream in our test applications (version 2).

```
x-request-id
x-b3-traceid
x-b3-spanid
x-b3-parentspanid
x-b3-sampled
x-b3-flags
x-ot-span-context
```

The mixers will send all this information to jaeger backend and we we can access the jaeger UI to analyze the traces and span.

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward -n istio-system $(kubectl get pod -n istio-system -l app=jaeger -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 16686:16686 &
``` 

Another backend integrated with the mixer is prometheus. We can define our own metrics and wire it up with prometheus handler to create rules based on the attributes passed by proxys to mixer. Let's create a new metric

```yaml
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: metric
metadata:
  name: kbrequestsize
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  value: request.size | 0
  dimensions:
    connection_security_policy: conditional((context.reporter.kind | "inbound") ==
      "outbound", "unknown", conditional(connection.mtls | false, "mutual_tls", "none"))
    destination_app: destination.labels["app"] | "unknown"
    ...
    source_workload_namespace: source.workload.namespace | "unknown"
```

And a new prometheus handler for that metric

```yaml
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: prometheus
metadata:
  name: kbsizehandler
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  metrics:
  - name: kb_request_size # Prometheus metric name
    instance_name: kbrequestsize.metric.istio-system # Mixer instance name (fully-qualified)
    kind: COUNTER
    label_names:
    - reporter
    - source_app
    - source_principal
    - source_workload
    - source_workload_namespace
    - source_version
    - destination_app
    - destination_principal
    - destination_workload
    - destination_workload_namespace
    - destination_version
    - destination_service
    - destination_service_name
    - destination_service_namespace
    - request_protocol
    - response_code
    - connection_security_policy
```

And then wire it up in a rule

```yaml
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: rule
metadata:
  name: kbrequestsizeprom
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  actions:
  - handler: kbsizehandler.prometheus
    instances:
    - kbrequestsize.metric
  match: context.protocol == "http"
```

So new we can generate some traffic and check the new metrics in prometheus.

```bash
$ kubectl -n istio-system port-forward $(kubectl -n istio-system get pod -l app=prometheus -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 9090:9090 &
``` 

Also we can enable grafana in istio and it has a nice dashboard by default that shows some default istio metrics in a nice way.

```bash
$ kubectl -n istio-system port-forward $(kubectl -n istio-system get pod -l app=grafana -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 3000:3000 &
```

Finally we can check the service graph tool that will allow us to see the dependencies between our micro services

```bash
$ kubectl -n istio-system port-forward $(kubectl -n istio-system get pod -l app=servicegraph -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8088:8088 &
```

And after generate some traffic we can check `http://localhost:8088/force/forcegraph.html` to see the graph with the services.

## Troubleshoutting 

- Check always all components in the `istio-system` are running correctly. In case Pilot is `Pending` because of resources, remove the limits, for the demo purpose is enough.

- In case executing curl commands return `connection refused`, ensure port and IP address are  correct and the ingress gateway service (in `istio-namespace`) is created with type NodePort.

- In case Prometheus complaints about time differences between browser and nodes, we can run ntp server to sync the date, ssh to the nodes and execute
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ntpdate
$ sudo ntpdate 1.ro.pool.ntp.org
```
